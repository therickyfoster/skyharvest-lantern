## Overview

**SkyHarvest Lantern™** is a **multi-functional portable lantern** that provides **solar-powered lighting, air purification, and backup bioluminescent glow** for homes, campsites, and emergency scenarios.  

The lantern’s **mycelium-carbon filter core** passively cleans indoor or outdoor air, while the **bioluminescent organisms** provide a soft, renewable light source when battery power is depleted.

---

## Core Features

- **Solar-Powered LED Lighting** – Charges during the day, powers light at night.  
- **Air Purification** – Mycelium-carbon core filters **VOCs, particulates, and CO₂**.  
- **Bioluminescent Backup Mode** – Soft natural glow runs **indefinitely without battery use**.  
- **Durable & Portable** – Lightweight and weather-resistant, ideal for outdoor and emergency use.  
- **Rechargeable & Sustainable** – No disposable batteries; compostable filter core.

---

## How It Works

1. **Solar Charging** – High-efficiency solar panel charges the integrated battery pack.  
2. **Air-Cleaning Core** – Mycelium and activated carbon absorb pollutants while the lantern operates.  
3. **LED Lighting** – Provides bright illumination for **8–12 hours per charge**.  
4. **Bioluminescent Mode** – Backup light source that requires **no electricity or charging**.
